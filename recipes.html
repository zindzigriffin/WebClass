    <h1> Cooking with Eoxtic Meats </h1>
    <h2> Zebra Stew Recipe </h2>
    <h3>Zebra Stew</h3>
<p> 1 & a half lbs. zebra meat, using topside </p>
<p>1 tablespoon flour</p>
<p>Good pinch of mixed herbs
1 lb. tomatoes, peeled
Salt and pepper</p>
<p>Pinch of celery salt</p>
<p>3 tablespoons oil</p>
<p>1 large onion</p>
<p>Pinch of paprika</p>
<p>1 cup stock or Knorr-Swiss onion soup</p>
<p>half a cup cream</p>
<p>Cut meat into stewing pieces, dip in seasoned flour and brown in oil.  Add tomatoes, quartered and seeds removed, then the stock or soup and seasoning.  Simmer until tender, depending on age of zebra. Just before serving add cream and a little red wine, if available. </p>
<h3> Cooking with Kangroo </h3>
<p>First the meat should be soaked in oil for at least 15 min prior to cooking.  It should then be placed in a very hot pan and quickly turned over to ensure all sides are 'seared', that is browned.  This will seal the meat up to prevent moisture loss. </p>

<p>If pan frying the temperature can then be turned down a little and the cut cooked to medium rare.  If roasting it can be transferred to the oven, but once again not cooked further than medium rare.</p>
<p>Stir Fry: (5mm thick) 1 minute maximum</p>
<p>Kebabs: (1.5cm cubes) 2 minute per side (leave space between cubes)</p>
<p>Medallions: Steaks (2.5cm thick) 2-3 minutes per side.</p>
<p>Roasts: Brown in pan then cook in pre-heated oven for 8-12 minutes per 500gms at 220 degrees Celsius or 15-20 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius (thick roasts may take longer than thin regardless of weight). </p>
<h3> Cooking with Crocodile </h3>
<p>Preparation, uses, and tips: 
Braising 
Rinse crocodile or alligator tail meat, pat dry with a paper towel, and cut into cubes. Sautee onions and spices in a skillet. Add meat and a small amount of cooking liquid. Simmer until tender, about 40 minutes. Pan-frying 
Rinse crocodile or alligator tail steaks and pat dry with a paper towel. (For blackened alligator steak, rub meat with a mixture of spices.) Heat a skillet until hot. Add oil or butter. Sear steak for two minutes, turn and sear the other side for another two minutes. Larger steaks may take up to a total of five minutes. For alligator balls, mix ground meat with egg and spices, dredge in flour, and fry until brown. </p>
<p>Stewing 
Rinse crocodile or alligator meat, pat dry with paper towel, and cut into cubes. Dredge in flour and spices. Brown in oil if desired. Then put in a Dutch oven and cover with liquid and herbs, spices, and vegetables. Cook in a preheated oven at 325 degrees F (160 degrees C), or on the stovetop over low heat until meat is tender. </p>
<p>Grilling 
Rinse crocodile or alligator tail and pat dry with paper towel. Marinate in milk and spices for three hours. Drain marinade and pat meat dry. Brush tail meat with oil and place on prepared grill with rack about 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15cm) from the heat source. Grill for about 10 minutes on each side. 
Broiling 
Rinse crocodile or alligator tail, pat dry with paper towel, and cut into slices. Lay slices on broiler pan, brush with butter, and place 6 inches (15cm) from element. Broil 10 to 15 minutes, turning halfway through. </p>
<h3> Cooking with Ostrich </h3> 

<p>Cooking times: Fry for approx. 3 to 4 minutes per side - check during cooking with a knife by cutting open slightly.  If grilling under a gentle heat, cook for approx. 6 minutes each side and check with a knife </p>

<p>Ostrich burgers 
Fry in a little light oil or grill under a low heat.  Ensure the burger is cooked all the way through but try not to over cook, particularly if using a grill as they will dry out.  The meat needs to be just brown. </p>

<p>Cooking times: Fry for approx. 6 - 8 minutes each side and check during cooking by slightly opening the burger with a knife or cook until the burger can be broken on one side with tongs. </p>

<p>Ostrich Roast 
The larger leg muscles are excellent for roasting as the weekend joint or even a mid-week treat, cold or hot!  Use a roasting bag to contain the juices and prevent the meat from drying out.  Centralize the meat in the roasting bag, do not pierce the bag, place on a tray in the preheated oven and cook as the instructions below. </p>

<p>Cooking times: Cook at a temperature approx. 150�C for 45 minutes per kg + 20 minutes.  Reduce cooking temperature by approx. 20�C if using a fan-assisted oven.  Check the product is cooked to your satisfaction as you would with any other joint. </p>
